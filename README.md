Over 200 million hours are spent collecting water daily by millions of women and girls worldwide. Their time for family, job, and education is constrained by this tragic reality. For these people, having access to clean water is essential to their survival and not just a luxury. This obvious injustice is what motivates H2OK, a project that was started out of a strong sense of empathy and a will to change things. H2OK's objective is to use QR codes to provide quick, precise, and up-to-date water information. Thanks to its seamless user experience, anyone with a smartphone can quickly learn about the safety of water sources, their cleanliness, nearby clean water access, and crucial water hygiene standards by scanning a code. Because HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used in its construction, the project is mobile-friendly, accessible, and simple to use anywhere in the world. We used QR codes and a bespoke data parsing tool that gives users immediate results based on the information scanned.
